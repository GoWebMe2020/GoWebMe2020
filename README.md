I am a driven and hardworking professional that, after an 18-year career in Construction Management, successfully re-trained in Software Engineering. Over the past 2 years, I have gained comprehensive experience in Full Stack Software Engineering; and demonstrated an ability to work effectively independently and as a key contributor to a team. With a natural ability and desire to learn and master new technologies, I enjoy developing and maintaining software functionality with high-quality code.

# Hobbies<a name="hob"></a>
Since I started coding, I do enjoy sometimes practicing different methods and techiniques of development. In the summer months I also enjoy being outdoors. I have spent a lot of time around wildlife and camping. From time-to-time I also find myself lost online in an imaginary world. And, every chance I get, I enjoy a good day or night out with friends and family.
