Trying to follow my passion, put my imagination to work and create all sorts of applications and software for the world to enjoy. I have a very strong construction background, having worked in vairous industry sectors from residential build, to petro-chemical and power generation, in South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique and the UK. I have gained a lot of valuable soft skills as a result which include, but are not limited to, good communcation, working in a team, working as an individual, planning, structure and design.

I have always been facinated with technology and how the tech world continues to grow and impress. I still remember putting together my first PC, using only spare parts, which was a 286. Decades later, at the start of 2020, with very little to do in lockdown I decided to complete a few courses online on fullstack development. Thereafter, I found some fantastic developers online that I started to follow (not sure if I can mention them). I have developed some websites for others or as practice, but my greatest achievement at this point (April 2021) is developing my own website with a password protected blog using a variety of languages. I still can't tell if I managed to build the site because I am a fast learner or because I am like a dog with a bone when I have an end goal in mind.

I am an extrovert, I like to be able to physically see the result of my hard work and I am unbelievably eager to learn. I am very excited to be part of the Makers April 2020 cohort and very much looking forward to networking and working with likeminded people. Head down to the contacts section and lets connect. Can't wiat!

## Experience<a name="exp"></a>


When I completed school, construction was the only industry that were looking to employ in and around the very small town I grew up in. So I became a **Structural and Pipe Welder** for a large construction company called Grinaeker LTA. After some time, once I had saved enough, I had the choice of studying either Quality Control or Health and Safety. Considering that I had a minor incident that could've been avoided intirely, I decided to study Health and Safety Management as this was a profession that was in demand.

After completing my training, I got a job as a **Junior Health and Safety Representative** in 2001 in the same industry for a Mechanical & Electrical contractor. After a year my contract ended and I then worked for Wetback Contractors who then promoted me to a **Health and Safety Advisor**. My end goal then was to work for a company called NOSA as a **Health and Safety Consultant, Auditor and Trainer** which I achieved. I ended up working for them for nearly 10 years and ended up being promoted to a **Regional Manager**. In 2015, I spent some time in the Netherlands and finally moved to the UK where I continued my career at Dornan Engineering and Ballymore Construction as a **Health, Safety and Logistics Construction Manager** (a mouth full really).
  
Since February 2020, I have been learning how to code. I completed a few online courses through Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, etc. I have also followed some online professionals that have presented very valuable courses and code-alongs. I have also learnt how to google and rearch things very well. In my spare time I practice as much as I can and try to develop my own webpages or applicaions. Even if it is creating a simple register and login webpage using passport. I have also developed a live websites and part thereof that is still active. I really enjoy putting in the work and then seeing the outcome. It is very rewarding.

Hi, my name is JP Ferreira and this is GoWebMe

Iâ€™m currently changing my career from being a Construction Manager to fulltime developer. I'm interested in in learning as much as I possibly can at the moment.
I have been coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the past year. Of late, I have started learning Ruby as I am starting the Makers Acedemy course on the 29th of March 2020.

I will be adding any projects I complete into my repository and I will keep this up to date. I will appreciate any help I can get.
