#Projects

Hi, my name is JP Ferreira and this is GoWebMe

Iâ€™m currently changing my career from being a Construction Manager to fulltime developer. I'm interested in in learning as much as I possibly can at the moment.
I have been coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the past year. Of late, I have started learning Ruby as I am starting the Makers Acedemy course on the 29th of March 2020.

I will be adding any projects I complete into my repository and I will keep this up to date. I will appreciate any help I can get.
