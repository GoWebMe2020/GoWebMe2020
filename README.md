# Hobbies<a name="hob"></a>
Since I started coding, I do enjoy sometimes practicing different methods and techiniques of development. In the summer months I also enjoy being outdoors. I have spent a lot of time around wildlife and camping. From time-to-time I also find myself lost online in an imaginary world. And, every chance I get, I enjoy a good day or night out with friends and family.
